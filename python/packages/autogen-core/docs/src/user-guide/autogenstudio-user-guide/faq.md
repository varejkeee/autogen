# FAQ

## Q: How do I specify the directory where files(e.g. database) are stored?

A: You can specify the directory where files are stored by setting the `--appdir` argument when running the application. For example, `autogenstudio ui --appdir /path/to/folder`. This will store the database (default) and other files in the specified directory e.g. `/path/to/folder/database.sqlite`.

## Q: Can I use other models with AutoGen Studio?

Yes. AutoGen standardizes on the openai model api format, and you can use any api server that offers an openai compliant endpoint.

AutoGen Studio is based on declaritive specifications which applies to models as well. Agents can include a model_client field which specifies the model endpoint details including `model`, `api_key`, `base_url`, `model type`.

An example of the openai model client is shown below:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "model_type": "OpenAIChatCompletionClient",
  "api_key": "your-api-key"
}
```

An example of the azure openai model client is shown below:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "model_type": "AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient",
  "azure_deployment": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "api_version": "2024-02-15-preview",
  "azure_endpoint": "https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/",
  "api_key": "your-api-key",
  "component_type": "model"
}
```

Have a local model server like Ollama, vLLM or LMStudio that provide an OpenAI compliant endpoint? You can use that as well.

```json
{
  "model": "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF",
  "model_type": "OpenAIChatCompletionClient",
  "base_url": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
  "api_version": "1.0",
  "component_type": "model",
  "model_capabilities": {
    "vision": false,
    "function_calling": true,
    "json_output": false
  }
}
```

```{caution}
It is important that you add the `model_capabilities` field to the model client specification for custom models. This is used by the framework instantiate and use the model correctly. Also, the `AssistantAgent` and many other agents in AgentChat require the model to have the `function_calling` capability.
```

## Q: The server starts but I can't access the UI

A: If you are running the server on a remote machine (or a local machine that fails to resolve localhost correctly), you may need to specify the host address. By default, the host address is set to `localhost`. You can specify the host address using the `--host <host>` argument. For example, to start the server on port 8081 and local address such that it is accessible from other machines on the network, you can run the following command:

```bash
autogenstudio ui --port 8081 --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Q: Can I export my agent workflows for use in a python app?

Yes. In the Team Builder view, you select a team and download its specification. This file can be imported in a python application using the `TeamManager` class. For example:

```python

from autogenstudio.teammanager import TeamManager

tm = TeamManager()
result_stream =  tm.run(task="What is the weather in New York?", team_config="team.json") # or wm.run_stream(..)

```

<!-- ## Q: Can I deploy my agent workflows as APIs?

Yes. You can launch the workflow as an API endpoint from the command line using the `autogenstudio` commandline tool. For example:

```bash
autogenstudio serve --workflow=workflow.json --port=5000
```

Similarly, the workflow launch command above can be wrapped into a Dockerfile that can be deployed on cloud services like Azure Container Apps or Azure Web Apps. -->

## Q: Can I run AutoGen Studio in a Docker container?

A: Yes, you can run AutoGen Studio in a Docker container. You can build the Docker image using the provided [Dockerfile](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/autogenstudio/samples/apps/autogen-studio/Dockerfile) and run the container using the following commands:

```bash
FROM python:3.10

WORKDIR /code

RUN pip install -U gunicorn autogenstudio

RUN useradd -m -u 1000 user
USER user
ENV HOME=/home/user \
    PATH=/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH \
    AUTOGENSTUDIO_APPDIR=/home/user/app

WORKDIR $HOME/app

COPY --chown=user . $HOME/app

CMD gunicorn -w $((2 * $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) + 1)) --timeout 12600 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker autogenstudio.web.app:app --bind "0.0.0.0:8081"
```

Using Gunicorn as the application server for improved performance is recommended. To run AutoGen Studio with Gunicorn, you can use the following command:

```bash
gunicorn -w $((2 * $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) + 1)) --timeout 12600 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker autogenstudio.web.app:app --bind
```
